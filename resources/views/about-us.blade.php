                                        are based on needs expressed by partner communities by which they can possibly offer solutions and new perspectives

                                        The faculty is expected to craft rubrics for each area visit/work to assess how the learning objectives are achieved
                                        as the students progress in their engagement. Service learning components such as area work performance, final SL
                                        outputs, presentation of SL outputs to partner community, summative reflection, attendance during the processing

                                        just and humane society. This approach aligns with Jesuit traditions, fostering qualities of mind and heart essential
                                        for collaborative work for the common good. It combines academic instruction with meaningful community service,
                                        consistent with Ignatian spirituality and the Jesuit mission of educating for justice. Through regular reflection,
                                        end-of-semester processing sessions, and mentoring, students deeply engage with their communities, gaining insights
                                        that challenge their preconceived notions and inspire active participation in societal change. As articulated by J.
                                        Kavanaugh in "Jesuit Higher Education," the essence of education is justice, grounded in human dignity and aimed at
                                        human freedom.

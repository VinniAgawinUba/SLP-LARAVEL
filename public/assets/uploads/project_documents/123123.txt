A few things to keep in mind while completing this activity:
1.	Do not use the browser Back button or close or reload any exam windows during the exam.
2.	Do not close Packet Tracer when you are done. It will close automatically.
3.	Click the Submit Assessment button in the browser window to submit your work.
Assessment Objectives
•	Part 1: Build the Network
•	Part 2: Develop an IP Addressing Scheme
•	Part 3: Configure Basic Device Settings
•	Part 4: Configure Security Settings on R1 and S1
•	Part 5: Configure the Hosts and Verify Connectivity
Instructions
In this assessment you will configure the R1 router and S1 switch, as you have done in the activities in this course. You will also connect two PCs using a switch and a router that are in the main wiring closet. You will subnet the 192.168.10.0/24 network to provide IPv4 addresses for two subnets that will support the required number of hosts. The larger subnet (LAN 1) requires 100 hosts and the smaller subnet (LAN 2) requires 50 hosts.
No subnet calculators may be used.
Part 1: Build the Network
a. Build the network according to the logical topology by placing the required equipment in the wiring closet equipment rack.
b. Cable the network devices in the closet as shown in the topology diagram.
c. Connect the hosts as shown in the topology diagram.
Part 2: Develop an IP Addressing Scheme
In this part of the assessment you will develop an IP addressing scheme. You will subnet an IPv4 network to create two subnets with the required number of hosts. You will also subnet an IPv6 network. You will then assign the addresses according to the requirements below.
Work with the following information:
•	IPv4 Network: 192.168.10.0/24
•	Required number of hosts in IPv4 LAN 1: 100
•	Required number of hosts in IPv4 LAN 2: 50
a. Record your subnet assignments according to the following requirements.
1) Assign the first IPv4 address of each subnet to a router interface
•	LAN 1 is hosted on R1 G0/0/1
•	LAN 2 is hosted on R1 G0/0/0
2) Assign the last IPv4 address of each subnet to the PC NIC.
3) Assign the second IPv4 address of LAN 1 to S1 SVI.
Part 3: Configure Basic Device Settings
Network devices must be configured over a direct console connection.
Step 1: Configure Basic Settings
a. Disable DNS lookup on R1 and S1
b. Configure router hostname using the name R1.
c. Configure switch hostname using the name S1.
d. Configure an appropriate banner on R1 and S1.
e. Allow console logins with the password C@nsPassw!
Step 2: Configure Interfaces
a. Configure R1 G0/0/0 and G0/0/1 interfaces using the addressing from the previous part of this assessment:
•	Interface description
•	IPv4 address / subnet mask
b. Configure the S1 VLAN 1 SVI interface using the addressing from the previous part of this assessment:
•	Interface description
•	IPv4 address / subnet mask
•	The switch should be reachable from devices on other networks.
Part 4: Configure Security Settings on R1 and S1
Step 1: Configure enhanced password security
a. Configure NoOneShouldKnow as the encrypted privileged EXEC password
b. Encrypt all plaintext passwords
c. Set minimum password length to 10 on R1.
Step 2: Configure SSH on R1 and S1
a. Configure netsec.com as the domain name
b. Configure a local user netadmin with the encrypted password Ci$co12345
c. Set login on vty lines to use local database.
d. Configure the vty lines to accept SSH access only.
e. Generate an RSA crypto key using 1024 bits modulus.
Step 3: Secure switch ports on S1
a. Shut down all unused ports on S1.
b. Enter descriptions for all unused switch ports to indicate that they are intentionally shutdown.
Part 5: Configure the Hosts and Verify Connectivity
Configure both hosts with the IPv4 addresses that were assigned in Part 2 of this assessment.
